### Hi. I'm Jeroen ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I'm a data engineer with experience in financial services. Keen eye for regulatory requirements, security, front- and back office processes, enterprise architecture and user experience.

ðŸŒ± Specific fields of interest currently are cloud native development and serverless architecture.

âš¡ Off work you can find me exploring the world, learning languages, enjoying good food and on the lookout for a good espresso.
